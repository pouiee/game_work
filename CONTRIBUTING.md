# Guideline for Contributions

Hello and welcome to this document.

## Joining the Team

  I am a solo developer for the foreseeable future, and while I do like to perform and learn every aspect myself, I do realize that
it is more productive to have more specialized members performing better versions of the same tasks. That being said, I am open
to others joining me in development and any such requests can be made at my email: jonathan.jasso5@gmail.com . I am very good with
criticism and overall working in a team environment but I do ask that my fellow teammates share my vision, not necessarily an
exact one-to-one with mine, but in such a capacity that you are excited to work with me on this. I think of myself as a reasonable
person and I am 100% okay with admitting that someone else can come up with better ideas than I can, any and all ideas can and
will be recieved with open arms and ears.

## Contributing

  Whether you join the team or not, I welcome any contributions in the form of comments, issues (discussed below), and assistance
in coding, art, etc. I only ask that your contributions have a reason behind them (and explain the reasoning), are respectful, and
are made in good faith. Speaking specifically about artwork, I have been using the Aseprite software to create art and thus have files
with an aseprite file type. I will also be adding certain editions of those files that are in PNG format, but upon request I can provide
any file type necessary for your editing needs.

  Suggestions in the form of comments have a special place in the game development environment,
I see AAA game developers with these visually and mechanically spectacular products, but there are some aspects of the game that are
lacking. Then I hear what reviewers and people who comment on their videos would instead prefer from the game and I feel that
community-sourced ideas can definitely have a positive impact on the game. I would like to encourage comments of this nature as
well as maybe what should be focused on during development, what makes the game fun. After all, that's what this is all about, isn't
it?

## Error Reporting

  I really appreciate any and all contributions made to my project, and developing a game alone is difficult. As such, a great way 
to assist is to bring up issues, spelling errors, and bugs with the actual game as well as a brief summary of the conditions 
necessary to reproduce the error. I don't expect my code to be perfect in any form and I am sure that a plethora of bugs will
be introduced and squashed before my final product is created, but I will do my best to squash the most I can, with focus on
the most problematic.

Thank You and Happy Travels,

Jonathan Jasso

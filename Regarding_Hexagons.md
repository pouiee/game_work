# The Hexagon Talk

My relationship with hexagons spans back to an earlier game development attempt with my best friend, Ian, where we were working on a tactics-like 
game that had a rich story behind it. I undertook the task of creating a huge collection of lore and story, thinking that a captivating story and 
my creative story writing side would carry its own weight in the end. I was mistaken, of course, and Ian took on the brunt of the work, starting
with a map editor and the programming side of development. Ian wasn't much of a tactics game player by trade, and I, being an enjoyer of the 1997 
'classic' Final Fantasy Tactics, was used to the common limitations and conventions of the genre. His first playthroughs of tactics games came up 
with a revelation, that the square-grid based movement created unnecessary constraints on the player and was in no way realistic, he instead proposed 
a hexagon-based grid system instead. He began work on the hex-based grid and after days of trying to make it work, he couldn't get it quite working 
the way it should've worked. He then transitioned to a square-based one and I honestly didn't think much of it after that.

After our game development sort of fell apart and real life took over, the prospect of a hexagonal grid stayed in my mind, festered like a little 
tomato on a vine. I would take hours just drawing different shapes, trying to find out what was so appealing about a hexagon in place of a square. 
After probably tens of pages of different squares, hexagons, even triangles and circles, I finally saw it, the beauty of the hexagon. Perfectly even sides, 
with equivalent angles on every corner, accessibility that would make a square cry, and finally, the fact that a square needed to be rotated along its
x and y axes to be at an 'isometric perspective' while the hexagon need only be drawn on its horizontal sides to achieve the same perspective. With 
this, I began my jouney to perfect the art of the hexagon and make Ian's dream a reality.

Thank you for your interest and support!

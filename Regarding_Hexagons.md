# Hexagon Talkagon

I usually pick the deprived class (starts with pretty much nothing) in Dark Souls, not because of the potential statistic optimization or
some other benefit of literally depriving yourself of power when you begin the game. It's because of a fundamental flaw in the way I approach
life in general. I prefer to take the most difficult route and when I don't get the results I want, I can get stuck in a place where I've
allocated too many resources to the task and I give up as a result. There is a sense of perfectionism that I feel is driving this course of
action and it is something that I will have to learn to shape into a powerful tool during my future in game development. But I digress.

So that brings me along to the topic of hexagons and a little about my past. My relationship with hexagons spans back to an earlier game 
development attempt with my best friend, Ian, where we were working on a tactics-like game that had a rich story behind it. I undertook the
task of creating a huge collection of lore and story, thinking that a captivating story and my [lack of] experience with writing would carry
its own weight in the end. I was mistaken, of course, and Ian took on the brunt of the work, starting with a map editor and the programming
side of development. Ian wasn't much of a tactics game player by trade, and I, being an enjoyer of the 1997 'classic' Final Fantasy Tactics, was
used to the common limitations and conventions of the genre. His first playthroughs of tactics games came up with a revelation, that the square-
grid based movement created unnecessary constraints on the player and was in no way realistic, he proposed a hexagon-based grid system instead.
He began work on the hex-based grid and after days of trying to make it work, he couldn't get it quite working the way it should've worked. 
He then transitioned to a square-based one and I honestly didn't think much of it.

After our game development sort of fell apart and real life took over, the prospect of a hexagonal grid stayed in my mind, festered like a little 
tomato on a vine. I would take hours just drawing different shapes, trying to find out what was so appealing about a hexagon in place of a square. 
After probably tens of pages of different squares, hexagons, even triangles and circles, I finally saw it, the beauty of the hexagon. Perfectly even sides, 
with equivalent angles on every corner, accessibility that would make a square cry, and finally, the fact that a square needed to be rotated along its
x and y axes to be at an 'isometric perspective' while the hexagon need only be drawn on its horizontal sides to achieve the same perspective. With 
this, I began my jouney to perfect the art of the hexagon and make Ian's dream a reality.

I will be updating this document with the math I used to make the dimensions of my hexagon tile assets in the future, so look forward to that!

Thank you for your interest and support!

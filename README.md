This repo is for my concept of a crafting tower game. 

I have recently started development and will be uploading my progress here. I don't have much experience with game development as a whole
but I am excited to make something of my own. For now, I am using the Godot game engine with C# to develop my game as well as Aseprite
for art.

I have always been a really big fan of games like Bloons TD, GemCraft, and my favorite game of all time is definitely Dungeon Defenders 
where I have almost 1500 hours across all iterations of the title. My dream game is probably a 3D tower defense game but it's safe to say I
have a long way to go before I'm ready to make it. I'm definitely no artist and I don't have much experience with game engines so this is
definitely something that will take a fair bit of time, but I'm willing to learn and grow in this process and make something I really love.
And yes, I know I shouldn't make something I love as my first project, but I will be doing tutorials and making some throwaway projects in my
spare time so hopefully that will help. I see this project as Risk of Rain was to the devs of that game, where they created a 2D version of
their game and their second game was a 3D version of the same game, their dream game.

This game will be a(/an) homage to the aforementioned tower defense games and I'm really just looking to have fun with it! I'm very comfortable 
programming in C# and I hope to translate that into a solid framework for my game. I am happy to discuss any and all questions about the project 
as they arise but for  now, my project will be sort of a traditional tower defense game with defenses centered around crafting. I hope to make a 
comprehensive (and fun!) system where materials (gained through enemy drops/ stage rewards/ boss kills) are combined to make new towers. To be honest, 
I don't know how I can implement this and I expect to spend a lot of brainpower on this topic but I think that this is a game that I would want to play
on my own if created in the right way. I envision it with a dash of Monster Hunter crafting, a smidge of Bloons Adventure Time TD (items affecting towers), 
and a pinch of Kirby: Squeak Squad power combinations.

If you have gotten this far, you truly have my respect for listening to my rambling and I thank you.

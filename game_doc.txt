crafting tower defence game
 ideas
 - random drops from enemies and bosses can be used to create new towers
 - start with multiple base towers
 - level-based (actual defense of bases)
 - no set tower areas (towers anywhere)
 - build/siege phase
 - DEFEND THE KEEP!
 - higher elevation -> longer range?
 - return to home base between stages?
 - reverse tower defense stages? (Conquests)

what I need:
 - enemy model
 - player model (extra)
 - whole map w/ path
 - attributes(?)
 - working demo on my way
